Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication :
   - verifies the identity of the user or service/ verifies who they are
   - protects the current user of other bad actors from accessing the current user's data
   -ex. trying to log in 

Authorization:
   - determines access rights
   - ex. if the person that is logged in has access to another user's log in info
   -authorization determines what a person can do in the system /once they login
